1gxzoqo,Looking for alternatives to nuclear and large-scale biomass for clean energy in Ohio,"I’m working on some ballot measures in Ohio aimed at combating climate change, specifically phasing out gas and coal plants over the next 15-20 years, with potential funding from the EPA. But I’m facing challenges finding alternatives to nuclear and large-scale biomass. Biomass, while useful on a smaller scale, has issues when scaled up, like sustainability and environmental impact. Nuclear is a low-carbon option, but the long-term storage of waste for hundreds of thousands of years is a major concern. I’ve also looked into hydro-power, particularly pumped storage systems, but they’re not reliable in Ohio during the cold winter months because the turbines freeze up. So, I’m looking for alternatives—wind and solar seem like obvious choices, but scaling them up across a large, spread-out state like Ohio, with fluctuating weather, is a big hurdle. Battery storage is promising, but I’m unsure how quickly the technology can be ramped up to meet our needs in the next couple decades. Geothermal could be a possibility, but I’m not sure if it’s feasible here. Ohio, with a population of around 11.8 million, is a large and diverse state, and while it leans conservative, I believe climate change is something that can unite people, especially if we frame it in terms of job creation and energy independence. I’m hoping to get some input on what other clean energy alternatives might work at scale without relying on nuclear or large biomass plants. Anyone have thoughts or suggestions? Looking for a serious discussion, Thank You!",2024-11-23 13:32:00,0.3666666666666667,0.0228741496598639

1gxanwn,Lynne Balzer: Exposing the Great Climate Change  Lie,"The book argues that climate change concerns are exaggerated and makes several main assertions:

- Questions the accuracy of temperature records and climate models
- Claims CO2 has minimal impact on global temperatures
- Suggests natural climate variability explains observed changes
- Critiques renewable energy policies
- Alleges political/financial motivations behind climate science consensus

Has anyone else read the book yet?
I just started reading because the reviews all say how greatly the explanations are and how much they've been misled.

I am dumbfounded about the statements made in the book so far and don't know how people believe anything in this book but I can see how it appeals to people who are not going to do their own research. 

The way the book is written is pretty persuasive and uses scientific evidence to support its claims although I have yet to research the actual evidence and how truthful it is.

How would anyone even combat this type of misleading?

1gwn1vo,Thermosyphon to remove heat from the ocean to desalination water,"Refined Thermosyphon System: Design and Operational Summary

The thermosyphon system is a cutting-edge, scalable solution designed to extract excess heat from ocean water, generate freshwater, and contribute to climate change mitigation. Through innovative integration of renewable energy, sustainable materials, and advanced technologies, the system provides a multifaceted approach to address critical global challenges, including water scarcity, ocean warming, and environmental protection.
Core Components and Functions

    Central Thermosyphon Cylinder

        Heat Extraction:
        The vertical thermosyphon leverages the temperature gradient between warm surface water and cooler deep water. A working fluid (CO₂ or ammonia) absorbs heat from the ocean surface, causing the fluid to evaporate and rise through the system.

        Heat Rejection:
        The heated refrigerant flows to a heat rejection chamber, where it condenses within an insulated pool, transferring the extracted heat to the desalination process. The cooled fluid returns to repeat the cycle.

    Insulated Pool with Integrated Desalination

        Evaporation:
        The insulated pool captures the rejected heat, creating a warm environment that maximizes evaporation. The system is insulated to reduce energy loss.

        Condensation:
        A transparent cover traps evaporated water vapor, which is directed toward inclined condensation panels. These panels cool the vapor, causing it to condense into fresh water.

        Freshwater Collection:
        Condensed freshwater is funneled into gravity-driven drip channels leading to storage tanks. A separate outlet for brine ensures salinity is managed effectively.

    Concentric Structural Design for Stability and Efficiency

        Stability and Efficiency:
        The central thermosyphon is supported by radial horizontal arms, ensuring stability. Solar panels and flotation devices are arranged concentrically to optimize space for both energy collection and heat rejection.

        Energy Optimization:
        Solar panels provide auxiliary power, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing reliance on external energy sources. They also serve as partial shading for the desalination pool, reducing evaporation losses.

    Modular, Scalable, and Autonomous Operation

        Modular Pods:
        The system is designed with modular components, allowing for easy scalability to meet the needs of different regions. Pods can be connected or disconnected as required, offering flexibility for varying community sizes and environmental conditions.

        Autonomous Maintenance:
        Autonomous robots or drones can be deployed for cleaning, inspection, and maintenance, reducing human intervention and extending the system's lifespan.

    Advanced Environmental Protection

        Double-Wall Heat Exchanger:
        The heat exchanger is designed with a double-wall construction, allowing any refrigerant leaks to safely vent to the atmosphere, preventing contamination of the water and the formation of carbonic acid.

        Eco-Friendly Coatings:
        Non-toxic, anti-fouling coatings are applied to all exposed surfaces to prevent biofouling and corrosion. These coatings are made from sustainable, bio-based materials that minimize environmental impact.

        Brine Management:
        Brine discharge is managed using advanced filtration or concentration techniques, reducing the environmental impact. In some cases, brine can be converted into valuable byproducts like salt or magnesium for industrial uses.

Energy Efficiency and Carbon Capture

    Energy Storage and Hybrid Power Systems

        Battery Storage:
        Solar power is stored in batteries, ensuring continuous system operation during low sunlight or at night. This energy storage reduces the system's reliance on external power sources.

        Hybrid Power:
        Integration with wave energy converters or tidal turbines offers a consistent power supply, particularly in remote coastal areas, further increasing system efficiency.

    Carbon Capture and Sequestration
        Carbon Capture Units:
        The system can be equipped with carbon capture technologies that extract CO₂ from the atmosphere or seawater, sequestering it in deep oceanic storage or in mineralized forms, contributing to climate change mitigation.

    Phase Change Materials (PCMs):
        Thermal Energy Storage:
        The incorporation of PCMs within the system can store excess heat for later use, balancing fluctuations in energy demand and improving overall thermal efficiency.

Symbiosis with Marine Ecosystems

    Artificial Reefs and Aquaculture Platforms

        Marine Habitat Creation:
        The flotation devices and structural components can function as artificial reefs, providing habitat for marine organisms. This promotes biodiversity and supports marine ecosystems.

        Aquaculture Integration:
        The system can be integrated with sustainable aquaculture practices, such as fish farming or seaweed cultivation, providing additional food sources while also helping maintain water quality.

    Seaweed Farming for Carbon Sequestration
        Seaweed farms could be cultivated alongside the thermosyphon units, contributing to carbon sequestration while also supporting marine biodiversity and providing sustainable bio-products.

    Eco-Friendly Designs for Marine Life
        The system employs acoustic dampeners and low-profile designs to reduce noise pollution and physical disturbance to marine species, ensuring the system operates harmoniously within its environment.

Outreach and Community Engagement

    Public Awareness and Education
        An interactive dashboard can track system performance and environmental impact, offering transparency and educational opportunities for local communities, NGOs, and the general public.

    Eco-Tourism Integration
        The system can incorporate eco-tourism elements, such as observation platforms or guided tours, generating additional revenue to support ongoing operations and increasing awareness of sustainable ocean technologies.

    Collaborations with Governments and NGOs
        Partnerships with environmental organizations, local governments, and academic institutions can help further research, provide funding, and support system adoption in coastal regions.

Conclusion: A Scalable and Sustainable Solution

The refined thermosyphon system offers a self-sustaining, environmentally friendly solution for addressing global challenges such as water scarcity, ocean warming, and climate change. By integrating renewable energy, eco-friendly materials, modular design, and innovative cooling technologies, the system can be scaled to meet the specific needs of various regions while fostering symbiotic relationships with marine ecosystems. It represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable freshwater production, climate adaptation, and ocean conservation, with the potential for broad adoption by coastal communities, governments, and environmental organizations.

In other words, it's effectively arguing we wouldn't be able to build enough nuclear power stations to replace the existing coal/oil/gas ones in time.

I can therefore only assume that the solar and wind options it suggests are substantially easier to build (which makes sense), and that we can build enough of these in time to bring the emissions down.

But is there anything which outlines how many solar/wind sources we'd need to build to replace the existing dirty options? And that this is definitely feasible?",2024-11-11 18:25:21,0.0,0.0438034188034187

Of course it’s important and a huge setback Trump will cause, but from reading these points of views, I’m getting a few concepts.

It’s more profitable and cheaper to use sustainable energy than fossil fuels, 

The market is moving towards new energy products like electric vehicles, and even nuclear energy, so whether the US likes it or not, the longer they disengage, the further behind in the market, economy they will be. Just for this its in most countries’ interests to chase energy efficiency. 

The last time Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement, other countries stayed true. With their advancements and with renewable energy having economic incentive, US continues to lose its power and will be left behind. 

Eventually, even if the US was not compliant, the other countries with the majority will be able to slap taxes on us. Europe also has laws on imports to meet requirements for methane, so if we dont conform, we will only lock ourselves out of trade opportunities.

The US already has 10 million jobs in renewable energy compared to only 300k in fossil fuels. Even if Trump opposed green energy, there is naturally more economic opportunity there so regardless the market is going to go there.

1ght2jb,Invasive species,"Let me preface this by saying I understand the value of natives for biodiversity. Life has evolved alongside them, so certain species depend on them. 

But Invasive species have been conquering more and more of the world. Many humans aim to remove them to make room for natives again. 

To me it seems they are not considering the whole picture. If humans were to die out one day, the invasives would just come back anyways. So basically all we did was just delay evolution & natural succession and messed a little bit with the gene pool. 

Invasives are here now. I know people claim they do literally nothing for biodiversity but that’s not true. Nature adapts fast. I’ve seen many non native hedges and trees provide great bird & bug habitat. Also, over time these species would become more and more interconnected within an ecosystem. Removing invasives sets this process back. And in times of rapid climate change, we really can’t afford losing precious evolutionary adaptation.

In my eyes, invasives are very valuable in the fight against climate change. Tree of heaven for example grows crazy fast, sucking up a lot of carbon. It’s a perfect tree for pollarding and using the sticks as an energy source (I.e. in a rocket stove) in a carbon negative way, since the roots remain in ground and you’re not killing the tree when you’re harvesting it’s wood. 

My point is, that removing invasives to plant natives doesn’t always make sense, if the natives don’t have their preferred range of conditions anymore in 50-100 years and will end up being replaced by better adapted invasives anyways.

I won't quit climatology. No way. But I don't understand how we're supposed to function under this administration.

I asked my research advisor about it, and he said that all we really do is just not mention climate change. I'm not really satisfied with this answer though (and also I don't think he knows how bad this could potentially get). Am I really just supposed to ignore the root cause of something just because some people don't like what I have to say because it might hurt their wallet? Quite frankly, I think that's bullshit.

I'm supposed to be a scientist. You report what's real. Climate change is real. I will not sugarcoat anything because then I'm not doing my job as a scientist.

Don't get me wrong I knew a 2nd Trump term was very possible, but now it's hitting me like a bag of bricks. It's always been my dream job to work with NOAA, but now that may not even be possible. I didn't even know if I wanted to get my PhD, but I think that decision has been made for me now.

1gliod5,Is the rise of populism in developed countries a direct result of climate change…?!,"In all this talk about Trump being bad for reducing the immediate and medium term impacts of global warming, I am wondering if there is an argument to be made that his election as well as the rise of populism in Europe over the last few years is a direct or at least partial consequence of climate change.

Hear me out: there have been weather catastrophes of increasing impact and frequency for the better part of this century that are unquestionably driven by climate change (e.g. extreme heat in PNW, UK, Desert Southwest in the last few years, extreme drought in the Brazilian Amazon etc.). 

The mitigation of and recovery from those catastrophes requires increasingly more resources, which in turn drive inflation, disrupt supply chains and so on. Additionally, people are facing increasing restrictions in their day to day lives to avoid the impacts of climate change (take again extreme heat as an example that requires people to stay indoors with AC for the better part of a given day). 

Our thus far short-sighted, and inadequate response to these challenges has given a lot of space to people with simple answers by claiming it’s all a lie or easily dealt with because we are supposedly adaptable as a species or whatever else. 

All this to ask from a sociological perspective: Are we as a common people seeing the effects of climate change on our society already?

1gk85bo,Why do so many people who say they're anxious about climate change seem to love the actual effects of climate change?,"I posted a complaint on the Massachusetts sub about how newscasters (including on NPR) keep normalizing our insanely warm temps, namely by being happy and excited about it being 80 degrees on Halloween and then referring to temps in the 50s (when it should be the 40s or even the 30s rn) as ""chilly"" and crying ""winter is coming"" after like 7 people said they saw some flakes of snow in NH.

In response to my post, I got enormous pushback from 90% of people, all saying basically yeah climate change is happening but these are just a few hot days not a trend, why be a jerk about it, and just enjoy the warmth like a normal person. I guess it's cool to love the effects of climate change while still smugging liberal by showing off your belief that climate change writ large is real. It's even more rich coming from a state that prides itself on its ""tough New Englander"" image, replete with putting on tire chains, skating on frozen ponds, and taking the T to ski at Wachusett. Like, none of those things are going to happen this year or probably any that follow...

I've decided that most people think like the following: abnormally warm weather is ""nice"" and, after having experienced a couple weeks of it, anything less than that abnormally warm weather is ""cold"" and thus bad. Like, it's going to be 77 in a couple days here, and I know for a fact that the news is going to say that when it drops to the upper 50s the next day that ""the cold will return"" or something like that, even though the upper 50s are themselves what would've been considered abnormally warm a couple decades ago. 

One comment on another sub I read recently said that they think no one seems to care about climate change since the pandemic. I think that's true. It's like how people are way less aghast by Trump now than 4 (let alone 8) years ago. We're kind of tired, bored, and nihilistic as a nation now. Slouching toward inundation by the seas, mosquitos in January, and a world with no snow forevermore.

Connecting and understanding massive geospatial datasets or complex meteorological information can feel impossible – and often stops developers and data scientists in their tracks

There is a vast amount of remote sensing data, measured in petabytes, that can be very complex to handle.  To use this data effectively for specific environmental objectives data scientists need to preprocess data, often employing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for specific tasks, train AI algorithms, and develop deep learning models.

Environmental data is not well understood much less used as a strategic advantage. Developers that are tasked creating end-user applications that improve decision-making need to leverage data and insights across distributed data landscapes.

This is why IBM released Environmental Intelligence that provides an extensive set of APIs to easily ingest, process, and analyze environmental data. These tools enable integration of advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning into applications designed for environmental risk assessment, operational efficiency, and compliance with evolving sustainability standards.

1h27fqa,Question about climate change and the collapse of the gulf stream,"This is what I know(I won't go into specifics): The gulf stream works because the temperature difference in the water between the poles and the equator is high enough. Since the temperatures are rising the poles are melting. Hence the temperatures between the equator and the poles is equalizing. Slowing down the flow of water. This system distributes warmth around the planet. If it collapses there will be less warmth coming up to the norther hemisphere and the northern hemisphere will cool down. Now this creates a high temperature difference between the poles and the equator.

Wouldn't that just restart the gulf stream?

After the collapse. The temperature around the planet will still try to equalize. But the water stopped. So the atmosphere has to move instead. Creating massive storms.

Now the time between the collapse of the gulf stream and the restart of the gulf stream. How long would that be?

Let's say that the collapse is not that far away. And that the restart would follow just a few years later. And we haven't stopped clime change by that time. Would that mean that the temperatures are still rising and the next collapse of the gulf stream is going to happen even faster? Making even bigger storms? And what after that? would there be more collapses and restarts? Happening faster each time? Making bigger storms?

I am a bit confused about this issue. The later part of the post is just my hypothesis. Based on no real evidence just my gut logic. Which is not right all the time. So please can someone give me some answers? Preferably someone who studies these things.",2024-11-28 22:31:10,0.0,-0.0196730914588057

1gwr6ta,"Of the 1500 climate policies announced world wide, only 63 would reduce emissions","Editor’s summary From Science.org

“It is easy for countries to say they will reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, but these statements do not mean that the policies they adopt will be effective. Stechemesser et al. evaluated 1500 climate policies that have been implemented over the past 25 years and identified the 63 most successful ones. Some of those successes involved rarely studied policies and unappreciated combinations. This work illustrates the kinds of policy efforts that are needed to close the emissions gaps in various economic sectors. “—Jesse Smith

Abstract

Meeting the Paris Agreement’s climate targets necessitates better knowledge about which climate policies work in reducing emissions at the necessary scale. We provide a global, systematic ex post evaluation to identify policy combinations that have led to large emission reductions out of 1500 climate policies implemented between 1998 and 2022 across 41 countries from six continents. Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning–based extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO2. Our insights on effective but rarely studied policy combinations highlight the important role of price-based instruments in well-designed policy mixes and the policy efforts necessary for closing the emissions gap.”

>And a parallel report by [Climate Central](https://www.climatecentral.org/report/2024-hurricane-attribution), a nonprofit scientific research organization, applied the techniques developed in the Environmental Research paper to the 2024 hurricane season, finding that climate change increased maximum wind speeds for all 11 Atlantic hurricanes in 2024, increasing their highest sustained wind speeds by nine to 28 mph (14-45 km/h). 

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/)

>Potential intensity theory was pioneered in 1987 by MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel, who theorized that the wind speeds in hurricanes can be expected to increase about 5% for every increase of one degree Celsius (1.8°F) in tropical ocean temperature, assuming that the average wind speed near the surface of the tropical oceans does not change. [Computer modeling has found](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/17/18/1520-0442_2004_017_3477_iocwos_2.0.co_2.xml) a slightly smaller magnitude (4%) for the increase....

>Although a 10% increase in hurricane winds because of climate change may not sound like a big deal, it matters a lot because hurricane damage increases exponentially with wind speed. For example, [according to NOAA](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/four-ways-climate-change-likely-made-hurricane-helene-worse/), a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph (161 km/h) winds will cause 10 times the damage of a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (121 km/h) winds. This includes damage not only from winds but also from storm surge, inland flooding, and tornadoes. **Bottom line: A 10% increase in winds yields about a doubling in hurricane damage** (Fig. 2).  \[Boldface emphasis added.\]

Researchers determined about 45 percent of the economic damages caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton could be attributed to climate change, according to the article.

>They added that the analysis “likely underestimates the true cost of the hurricanes because it does not capture long-lasting economic impacts such as lost productivity and worsened health outcomes.”

So I’ve been reading a book about trees because I find them fascinating.
I’m not educated in “science” but I would love to hear the opinion of biologists and people that know more than me.

So, concerning climate change topics:

Trees are incredibly important to keep temperatures low (shade and retaining water, biomass and native animals). 
As an example, in Portugal, people destroyed the forest for the last 50 years. Where there were bushes and native species (such as oaks, olive trees, cork trees…) now is infestated with eucalyptus (exoctic tree that consumes a lot of water and doesn’t leave space for native trees). Portugal has great fires every year and many acres of land are burnt. Mostly this kind of trees or what’s left of the native forest.

Can we relate the rise of temperatures to the different trees we have in a certain place? 
If your village is surrounded by eucalyptus, you probably will have a hotter summer, right?

Is it accurate to say that we have a huge human impact on climate change through trees and silviculture and not only through cars and fossils?

1gskidh,Someone help me with this points please..,"Recently, a climate skeptic from my country presented these arguments against human-caused global warming in a list of comments on YouTube from a video about man-made climate change.  Could an expert here  help me evaluate these points of view, please?

His arguments are the following:

1. Firstly, humanity's CO2 emissions represent only 7% of the total amount released into the atmosphere, the rest being primarily from bacterial activity and, secondarily, volcanic.
2. Water (in its non-condensed form in clouds) in the atmosphere has the greatest greenhouse effect.
3. The author talks about climate stability during the pre-industrial period, mentioning 4 or 5 periods of climate change over billions of years! This is FALSE. In the last 2 million years, there have been about 7 glacial and interglacial stages, each of which can be broken down into several dozen sub-stages.
4. The idea of pre-industrial climate stability became entrenched due to a lack of paleoclimatic data (glacial deposits, geomorphological evidence, etc.), which mostly erode over time! For this reason, the Quaternary glaciation of the last 2 million years has those 7 stages and inter-stages, further subdivided into dozens of phases. In comparison, the Huronian glaciation from 2 billion years ago cannot be divided into stages and inter-stages because the evidence has eroded! Therefore, the idea that the climate naturally has less dynamism than today, or that it is inherently predictable and that things have become disrupted today, is a false idea! The atmospheric system is extremely dynamic, and what we call climate changes are simply shifts in climate zones that were never truly stable!
5. When we talk about global warming, most scientists who support this view refer to the Little Ice Age, between 1400-1850, without looking beyond this period! If we look beyond, there is a period 900-1000 years ago that was warmer than today!
6. By correlating graphs showing temperature values and CO2 levels, it can be observed that the rise in CO2 concentration lags by 200-400 years behind the rise in temperature values! So, first there is an increase in temperature, and then an increase in CO2 concentration follows.",2024-11-16 10:25:04,0.0,0.0028269675925925

1grdzlh,Even people who are left leaning seem under-educated on the climate - my thoughts from a farming background and seeking advice,"**My Background:** I live in the lovely northern state of Minnesota which right now is experiencing a drought all across the state from abnormal to severe conditions. The only people that seem to pay attention to things like this are people like myself who have a small family run farming operation in Wisconsin, also experiencing the same drought conditions. My mom who does the work on the farm tells me that ""you cannot educate the people who do not want to know"" and I think that this may be partly true but I also have a hypothesis that we have become so disconnected from nature that we do not appreciate it and we certainly have lost all respect for it. I come from a background of spending most of my life outside, where if I pulled a branch off of a living tree I had to apologize to it, where I had to learn about what bugs where invasive and which ones weren't and how to ride horse and why animals need to be respected or they won't respect you. 

**Why I Believe People are Disconnected:** What sparked this entire rant today was a single comment I made at work, ""I am hoping we are getting some snow soon."" You would think for a state notorious for blizzard conditions and long snow seasons that this would not be controversial but I was dog-piled by my group for even the mere mention of snow. ""Dont wish for snow!"" ""I want a winter just like the last one!"" (We got very little snow last year which is why we have been in a drought almost all year long!) This infuriates me beyond belief because I know these people believe in climate change and the first angry thoughts in my head are ""then why in the hell do you life here?"" I know I cannot confront people in this way so that is why I need to think about why are people so disconnected from the health of the earth? 

The vast majority of people now live in homes with central a/c and heating, soundproof windows, and warm insulation, which yes we need these things but what do they do? Our exposure to the elements has been cut off, it has been made optional. Listening to the birds, the wind, or just the sounds of the day have become something we choose not to do (or in my case I can't hardly stand having my window open where I live due to all the man made noise). In places like Minnesota and Wisconsin where I have lived my whole life people choose to not leave their homes when it's winter, which before climate change really started to show its true face would last a good 6 months and now its about 3-4, and would instead opt to stay inside, something that has become more and more of a trend as technology has become more prevalent in our lives. We no longer have community anymore, people do not go out and attend the big cross-country skiing events of yesteryear, do snowshoeing, ice skating, etc. I noticed this to be especially true in the larger city and suburban areas of Minnesota where people do not engage with one another, its really quite depressing. In becoming an urban people we have become so fragmented from the very ground that we walk on.

  
**I am Seeking Advice:** I come here seeking some guidance or ways to handle these frustrations, how can I approach people acting this way? It is easy for me to get upset that people do not understand that there is a drought, that wanting no snow will surely lead to no food/water, or wildfires. If I say these things to people then I become the ""bad guy"" because I am not only ""wishing for snow"" but I am actively bringing down everyone's mood by just simply telling them the hard truth that the world has not equipped them to hear. However I am really trying to engage all of those around me that I can because these topics are important and continuing to be ignorant to such things will only do themselves and others harm. 

  
***TLDR:*** people in MN/WI think having winters with no snow is good because they are so disconnected from nature they don't understand droughts. I believe people are disconnected from nature because of our urbanized/suburban/tech focused world where people never go outside and learn to respect the earth. I am looking for advice on how to approach these tough topics with people who come from these backgrounds that are so much different than my own so I can stop getting so frustrated but also hopefully get a good message across.",2024-11-14 20:10:38,0.0,0.0985399175740084
1gqvj3n,How survivable/livable would tropical/equatorial areas be by 2050 or the end of the century? Should I move to a more climatically secure region?,"Asking because although I currently live in SE Asia (Bangkok, Thailand), I am planning to leave the country and move to possibly the Great Lake Areas, or some other more climatically secure regions in the future as I'm also dual American citizen.

The problem is that since I live in Thailand most of my life due to the fact all my immediate family are locals (I'm the only one born in the USA although I never lived there except studying there for 4 years during my undergrad years and stayed very briefly in NYC for only two weeks). I don't really have any close connections or any places to stay outside the country.  Though, I do have some distant relatives and friends in the West but I'm not close enough to them to just easily pack my bags, jump on a plane, and go stay with them long term.  Also we owned a family business here, which generates a lot of our income and act as a financial backup for us in case of unemployment.

So my questions are how safe would the tropical/equatorial areas be by a few decades from now or 2100? I heard places like Bangkok, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh, Dhaka, Lagos etc. will submerged into the sea by 2050. How vulnerable and risky is my region from climate related disasters such as heat waves/wet bulb events, extreme tropical storms like typhoons, cyclones, flash floods, droughts and famine, water shortages, the resurgence of deadly diseases as the global temperature heats up?

Should I move or stay? What should I do?  I have learnt that the Arctic **warms 4x faster** than the Equator but overall, high latitude areas still seem safer and less vulnerable to climate change than the latter.

I have thought about some hilly or mountain areas in Thailand but those only comprised only very few % of the country's total land area (most of TH are lowlands). Unfortunately, the hills and mountains of this country are relatively low in elevation, so still at risk from heat waves. Also the lands there aren't that arable and suitable for crops, so there are tendencies for crop failures and drought. Furthermore, we often have a lot of wildfire issues in the mountains as well from people burning up grass and dry conditions.",2024-11-14 03:19:04,0.45,0.0441331923890063

My question is this:  Assuming in the not too far off future that Anthropogenic Climate Change finally impacts humanity enough to fatally disrupt agriculture. 

How big of a population die off would be required before we were finally to hit good emission numbers globally?  

Apologies for the indelicate wording. 
It would be an unimaginable misery to endure, which I do not mean to minimize and reduce down to numbers. However since our species seems insistent on heading down this road of resource mismanagement and greed, I am curious how many of us will have to perish before our greenhouse  emission activity is low enough to course correct. Or is that even an option?

1gqbls4,How can we lessen the damage climate change will have on civilization and quality of life?,"Ok so, we already know climate change has some pretty bad effects, but it most likely wont wipe out humanity. the question is, how could we lessen the suffering of people and fix society as much and fast as we can? and im not just talking about how we can lessen climate change, im talking how to deal with its effects for society. any ideas and theories are appreciated, ranging from political to cultural.

Personally, mine is that as a society we kinda will need to push an ""stronger together"" and ""we will prevail"" attitude to minimize the effects. i truly believe that in especially dire times, our modern internet cynicism, pessimism and misanthropy would be a TERRIBLE idea to keep. you know the sort that goes ""we can fix it but we wont."" ""we will kill ourselves and the planet for money."" ""we deserved this extinction."" ""we are boiling ourselves yet we act in denial.""

Lets say that we had a god's eye view and for sure knew: the realistic approach is we are doomed.

it still would be very impractical for most people (not all, but most) to repeatedly tell them that. therefore regardless of what is the most realistic scenario, we need to act as things can turn out fine and we can adapt. im not saying sugarcoat it or just bury your head in sand.

instead im opticating for: see the problem, see how bad it could be, naively think that things can work out if you try hard enough no matter what the situation is, and you might have better ending than spending that time trying to figure out how realistic it will end.

1gove36,“TV told me so”,"I’ve spent the past week talking to people about the recent US election—trying to figure out, in particular, why people voted for Trump.

One thing I’ve noticed is that people are trusting propaganda that visibly conflicts with reality.

How do we deal with this?

I’m concerned about the consequences for climate change because, although the scientific consensus is very clear on this subject—and although the average person has actually begun to *feel* the effects of climate change where they live—people have shown that they’re willing to completely disregard reality in favor of what the TV says. And what the TV is saying is that climate change is a hoax, that it’s an attempt by global “elites” to usher in communism by penalizing businesses, etc.

If our government isn't going to do anything, and actively make things worse, is there any amount of effort from everyday people that could improve things by any significant amount? Of course, I also understand that would require people to willingly participate in such measures, which based on this election and general behavior in the US, is not something many will do. I feel like the issue of combatting climate change is a reflection of the worst aspects of American culture: our greed, short-sightedness, and obsession with consumption. Everywhere you look, on every platform, there are ads trying to get you to part with your money for something you probably don't need. We consume wasteful products and seek novelty in cheap goods instead of other, healthier methods. And it doesn't even make us happier in most cases! We keep chasing happiness from something that will never grant it and trashes the planet in the process. I know a lot of messaging around climate change centers on fear and anxiety, and understandably given the enormity of what is happening and what is at stake.

but until then because we are hoping it doesn't come to it, I'm worried about water and food going up in price? we live in a row home. I already grow some plants but want to grow more vegetables. i'm thinking of setting up a hydroponic garden in the basement just to at least start something. I know groceries are going to skyrocket.

Could Trump be convinced that green tech represents a big new economic opportunity for the US that makes us more competitive than China? As in, not dismantling the IRA but rather improving upon it? 

Would Trump warm up to the idea of climate action (pun intended) if it were re-framed as making our natural spaces and resources ""great again"" by reducing pollution (e.g. that could include moving away from coal..) and making our systems more resilient (hello forest raking)? 

Would he move an inch on climate denialism if the topic were approached in a way that panders to his ego? For example, 'whether or not climate change is real..people believe that it is and are afraid. They need to feel like you're protecting them. And in case it does turn out to be real, dont you want your legacy to be as the president who saved humanity'? (Or something like that)

1gm2a4g,CMECH: A New Approach to Carbon Removal from Seawater – Looking for Feedback on Our Website!,"Hi everyone! We’re CMECH, a startup dedicated to fighting climate change by removing carbon dioxide directly from seawater. Our mission is to tackle one of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis and restore balance to the environment. Here’s a bit about us:

**What We Do:**
At CMECH, we’re developing innovative technology that targets the ocean—one of Earth’s largest carbon reservoirs—to extract and capture CO₂. By focusing on seawater, we’re taking action to address rising CO₂ levels and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet.

**Why We’re Doing This:**
The ocean absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide, but as emissions rise, it’s nearing its capacity. Excess CO₂ leads to acidification, warmer waters, and harm to marine ecosystems. Our goal is to help reverse this process and protect our environment for future generations.

**How You Can Help:**
Creating groundbreaking solutions like ours takes resources. You can support our mission by donating or purchasing carbon credits through our website. Every contribution accelerates our progress, helping us get closer to deploying large-scale carbon removal technology.

We’re excited to share our work with you and would love feedback on our new website, https://cmech.tech/index.html. Does it communicate our mission clearly? Any suggestions on the layout or content?

It was terrifying to think we’d be forced to watch as ineffective, symbolic policies became the new “solution” while the planet’s true needs were sidelined.

But waking up to see Trump win feels like a last-minute rescue, a glimmer of hope I didn’t expect. He’s shown that he’s not here for the empty gestures or the political showmanship. Instead, he’s opening the doors to practical solutions, market-driven advancements, and real innovation—the kind that has the power to actually change things. It feels like, finally, someone in leadership sees the big picture: that a balance is possible, where we can protect the environment *and* give industries the space they need to adapt and evolve.

For the first time in ages, it feels like there’s a future we can believe in—a chance to save the planet without destroying people’s lives along the way. It’s like we’re standing on the edge of something that could be real, and I’m breathing a sigh of relief that we escaped what felt like an impending climate nightmare.",2024-11-07 10:52:38,0.05,0.0223484848484848

Asking that myself, and researching flaws of available alternatives, led me to start a new project, to allow individuals to take measurable climate action through participation in forest restoration at scale.

Of course it should be treated as a complementary solution to political pressure and necessary systemic changes, and not as excuse to continue current state of affairs. But if we can do something extra in the meantime, why not? After all, we have to not only reduce our emissions, but also recapture already emitted CO2.

We are dedicated to plant new forests with mainly ecological functions and not industrial monocultures, to make an actual land cover change and provide additional ecosystem services. We also include trees’ survivability rate in our impact calculations, to not overestimate it. We partner with municipalities and regions, which provide necessary land, and already few of them declared interest in our project.

Our project allows to gradually build towards tangible impact through planting subscriptions. In our case, they are different from other subscription-based services, as you don’t lose your impact when decide to cancel it, as already planted trees will keep recapturing CO2 for you. Such model just makes reaching a proper scale of impact more available.

We also provide feedback on your planting contributions and CO2 recapture journey.

Currently we are building an international community of individuals, who would like to take such climate action with us, so I’d like to invite you to join and bring in your friends!

The thing that is bothering me right now, is wildfires and forest regeneration. 

Trees burn, leaving charcoal and grasses in their wake. The grasses choke out any trees, and are also easier to burn next season. Trees take decades to grow assuming conditions are right, and longer if the conditions aren't right. Shouldn't this mean that there's no way for trees to be replaced at this point? I mean they're still being replaced sure, but the replacement rate- shouldn't that be falling faster than it's growing?

I don't even really mean carbon release itself, I'm mostly worried about the ecological transformation of forests being unable to re-establish themselves in the wake of fires.

1gmpgkr,Could someone help me locate Kuwait's Net-zero carbon emissions strategy? ,"After some research, it appears that the Kuwaiti government, represented by the Environment Public Authority (KEPA), announced a goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. This announcement was made during last year’s COP, as reported by Kuwait News Agency (https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=3125088&language=en).

However, I struggled to find any detailed information about this strategy online. KEPA’s Climate Change page (https://epa.gov.kw/en-us/ClimateChange) doesn’t mention it, and the only other reference I found was a brief mention in KEPA’s magazine from earlier this year (source in Arabic: https://epa.gov.kw/Portals/0/pdf/EPAMagazine172.pdf). There was another brief mention from October event, where KEPA director stated that the strategy will achieve net zero by 2050 (!).

I’m honestly a bit confused. The country formally announced this strategy nearly a year ago, and it’s still being referred to, yet there’s no official documentation or published details available.

During my search, I identified two international consultants who contributed to the strategy’s study. According to them, they have already submitted all their work to their contracting agency, UNEP, which I understand is providing technical assistance to KEPA and basically drafted the strategy on their behalf.

The question now, is this normal when it comes to climate strategies? 

Shouldn't a strategy be made public for different parties prepare themselves for what to come that might affect them? 

Could the strategy development still being delayed? 

By the way, there is another net zero 2050 strategy in Kuwait, which is the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) strategy. However, my understanding is that this strategy is not netzero carbon emissions but rather net zero green house gas emissions... and not from KPCs Kuwait operations but GLOBAL operations. 

I was also not able to find any details on this, the fact that they intend to use CCSU, and that local research institute is currently investigation CCSU, makes me wonder if their strategy as well has not been fully developed and still in early stages.

We’re CMECH, a startup dedicated to fighting climate change by removing carbon dioxide directly from seawater. Our mission is to tackle one of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis and restore balance to the environment. Here’s a bit about us:

What We Do: At CMECH, we’re developing innovative technology that targets the ocean—one of Earth’s largest carbon reservoirs—to extract and capture CO₂. By focusing on seawater, we’re taking action to address rising CO₂ levels and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet.

Why We’re Doing This: The ocean absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide, but as emissions rise, it’s nearing its capacity. Excess CO₂ leads to acidification, warmer waters, and harm to marine ecosystems. Our goal is to help reverse this process and protect our environment for future generations.

How You Can Help: Creating groundbreaking solutions like ours takes resources. You can support our mission by donating or purchasing carbon credits through our website. Every contribution accelerates our progress, helping us get closer to deploying large-scale carbon removal technology.

We’re excited to share our work with you and would love feedback on our new website, https://cmech.tech/index.html. Does it communicate our mission clearly? Any suggestions on the layout or content?",2024-11-11 19:59:59,0.1704545454545454,0.2012626262626262

• China (the largest emitter) is ahead of schedule with Green Energy production and greenhouse gas reduction. It's crazy how fast they are transitioning to renewables. For example, solar power generation increased by 78% on one year. They now generate enough from Wind to power all of Japan. They manufacture 97% of the world's polysilicon solar panels and 60% of the World's Wind Turbines. They installed more Wind Turbines than the US or Europe. Energy generation from Coal decreased to 53% of overall generation this year and is expected to decrease below 50% next year i.e 47% of their electricity generation was provided by renewable energy.

• Russia is, well... Russia.

• EU and US are speeding up as well, especially with their new giant infrastructure bill. From what I've read they are exceeding expectations in funding and building of systems that will fast track them to net zero by 2040!!

Here's some raw data: 

• Renewable energy sources account for 30% of global electricity production in 2024. That number is expected to jump to 70% by 2029!! The investments and progress in technology development along with deployment is exponential!

• Costs to build these systems have plunged. Price of solar PV has decreased by 85%. Price of batteries by 80%. Price of electric cars and charging stations by 40%. Again, as more investments flow in and technology improves this will also increase exponentially.

• In 2024 electric vehicles amounted to 23% of global car sales. This number according to Bloomberg articles that I've read is expected to jump to 60% by 2030!!

• More and more countries are planning to build nuclear. According to some opinion articles that I've read, if what EU, Chinese and US leaders are planning to do with nuclear and a possible fusion technology, we could hit net zero by 2035!

I could go on and on, the positive news just keep on mounting. Then you add AI advancements to all of that and things get even better.

What I'm trying to say here is: we WILL be fine. We may face some substantial consequences like another immigration crisis, food shortages here and there, and a medium sized hit to the economy, but nothing so bad that would lead to total economic/population collapse or other things these doomers are saying.",2024-11-30 08:03:10,0.4166666666666667,0.0235130197183768

And the news and media we consume are going to sense that we’re hurting, then pull us into a feedback loop of hand-wringing and despair. But there is something else we can do: take whatever you’re feeling right now, and do something. Whether it’s anger, sadness, or fear, let it galvanize you to action. Do something today, and you will feel better. A few suggestions:

1. Conservatives have promised to “unleash fossil fuels”. But in many states, you don’t have to participate in that agenda; in many states, you have a right to choose your energy provider. It is often as easy as filling out a form. Competitive energy dot org has a great state by state map for this.

2. Research local environmental advocacy groups in your area, and take this opportunity to get connected. Even if it’s joining a facebook group or email list, it is a step towards sustainable legislation in your area.

3. Contact your lawmakers, ESPECIALLY at the local/municipal level. Tell them that sustainability is still a top priority for you as a voter. At the national level, most politicians are just going to tread the party line, which can make it feel like it’s useless to do this in conservative areas. But city council members, mayoral candidates, and other local authorities are much more in touch with the people, and your message may mean more.

1gpuuv0,Where would you say Colorado ranks on the “climate haven” spectrum now?,"Nowhere is going to be without effects. But everyone says the Great Lakes and the Northeast are the places to go for dampened effects. Yet, with rising temps comes more [poisonous algae blooms](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air-water-land-climate/blue-green-algae-and-harmful-algal-blooms). Walking around the lakes in Minnesota will reveal that the colors are already turning that toxic blue/green color. You’re never quite sure if it’s safe or not. The Northeast is also susceptible to major flooding, like in New Hampshire most recently. Plus look at Asheville, NC. What people thought were havens were actually very vulnerable.

So, let’s take a look at Colorado again, purely in the climate sense. Take water for example. Yes, they’re dry and the Colorado river is going to be a problem. The snow pack is going to dwindle, and there’s a greater chance of heavy rain. But they’re the headwaters of the river and get the freshest “drink” before it flows down towards Mexico. With xeriscaping, water reclamation, and conservation they may be fairly resilient to water scarcity. No?

What about wildfires and air quality. Seems like that’s inevitable. But Colorado is placing a lot of resources into forest management now. Thinning the forests, controlled burns, climate tech for prediction and rapid responses. Plus most states are exposed to the air quality issues if you haven’t noticed. Something burns in Canada and the jet stream wafts the smoke all other the Midwest. It burns in California, and Utah and Colorado get it too. So on, and so forth. 

They’ve got the elevation so extreme heat is less likely to be devastating. It’s dry, so less likely wet bulb conditions. No real tornadoes (at least on the Western side) due to the mountains and the shifting of tornado alley Southeast. No sea level rise or hurricanes. Elevation kills off a lot of the more-dangerous pests (except the mountain pine beetle, but see above for wildfires). Less AMOC/jet stream woes.

Plus it seems like it's turning into a climate tech center. Should Colorado be considered up there as a climate haven? What have I not considered, or am wrong about? Prove me wrong. ",2024-11-12 20:40:15,0.0,0.0085502989074417

1gts0g9,Quick West Coast AR Discussion,"Tl;dr: Reasonably nice winter storm approaching the North American West Coast right now. mountain snow, valley rain, wind for BC and WA. Resources on the bottom of post. 



Happy Sunday you lot! 

Just wanted to plug a quick Atmospheric River (AR) discussion on the US West Coast this upcoming week. The event stands out to me in terms of both intensity and duration so here goes: 

  
Synoptic Discussion: 

A current low pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska is moving southeast, expected to ""bomb out"" (>24mb/24 hour pressure drop) offshore the Washington/BC coast in the next day or two. This will for one bring pretty intense winds to the region and secondly tap into subtropical moisture. The low will serve as a conveyer belt for this moisture bringing some integrated water vapor values in excess of 750kg/(ms) on Tuesday for some hours to the central Oregon coast, oriented to the NE. While weakening some, the low is expected to be nearly stationary until Thursday or so, bringing prolonged precipitation from a line of the Califonia-Oregon border to interior British Columbia. 

Then, the low will drop further southeast, closer to the coast before splitting. One part will head North, the other South, both parallel to the coastline. This will bring a secondary push of impressive atmospheric moisture, this time oriented more directly west to east and a good bit further South (possibly all the way down to the San Francisco Bay Area) and support additional precipitation for all regions. This second push is again expected to last anywhere between 2 and 4 days, and quite possibly produce the basis of this years snow pack for the Northern Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascade mountain ranges (though the latter already received a few low- to medium end storms). 

  
Impact Discussion for PNW: 

The big three PNW cities (Vancouver, Seattle, Portland) will all receive substantial precipitation, especially during the first half of this impressive event. Some model runs forecast more than 5 inches of rain in Portland until Friday with peak rain rates on Tuesday and Thursday. Especially further North towards the US-Canadian border wind will be impactful enough to cause damages. Bottom line for the greater PNW: Make sure your drains are unclogged and loose objects tied down. Regular if strong winter storm for you. 

  
Snow Levels for PNW: 

From North to South, snow levels are expected to remain well above the surface - in Northern Washington, peak precipitation in the more populated areas occurs when freezing levels hover around 2000-2500ft (there are definitely some exceptions here). Especially in between the two moisture pushes, snow levels will fall enough to feature flurries to the lowlands for Northern Washington and to its Northeast. Further South all the way to the Upper Rouge basin, snow levels look to stay well above any larger settlements (Bend of course being an exception), with bigger accumulations confined to the mountain passes above 3000ft. Again, there is some variation with the arrival of the main moisture feeds but generally, this will be mostly rain for all those South of Vancouver, WA really. 

This will be an incredible boost to the already substantial snowpack of the Cascades all the way to Bend with some two or three additional feet expected in most regions there. 

  
Impact Discussion for California: 

Aside from Northern California in a line from say Fort Bragg to Yreka which will receive almost continuous rain from this event starting Tuesday night/Wednesday, most precipitation will arrive later in the week by Thursday/Friday. Note here that the NorCal/Oregon coastal region and mountains will get absolutely hammered and are looking at a very significant storm. 

How much and how far South the secondary system pulls is not entirely clear yet. There are ensemble runs that bring substantial AR conditions to the San Francisco Bay Area by next weekend, but with almost 7 days out, this can and will likely change. Current model thinking brings anywhere from 1-3 inches of rain to lower areas in the Bay. Ultimately, this depends on if a secondary low from our split system (the northern half of which by this time will landfall somewhere in the vicinity of Vancouver Island) can maintain the moisture conveyor belt from the Pacific, stay offshore, and sag South. With all those ingredients, 1-3 inches could be conservative for areas from the Sacramento River west. 

Most runs do see some shower type precipitation until the main event late next week. The event itself is quite likely to happen, the duration and strength of it uncertain however. Additionally, the southward extent will be limited. While the Big Sur coast may still see some meaningful precipitation, this does not look like the fire-season ending storm we would hope for in Southern California. There is some hope towards the end of the forecast period, 8-10 days from now; we shall see (the Climate Predictive Center does forecast above average precip for the entire West Coast including SoCal in the next 6-14 days). 

  
Snow Levels for California: 

There is some indication for seasonal to slightly above seasonal temperatures during the onset of the main event (I am focusing here mainly on the Northern Sierra and areas South). This translates to mixed precip or all rain up to pass level, including Donner. As the event continues snow levels will gradually drop and potentially offer substantial addition to the snowpack of the season so far. Using the North Fork of the American River as an example, much of the precip will fall with snow levels in excess of 8000ft, only dropping below 5000ft  during the latter half. Depending on how fast snow levels drop and how strong and south this secondary moisture push is by then, this can bring 2-4ft of snow for the High Sierra around the Tahoe basin. Bottom line: Stay weather-aware and prepare for a potentially strong storm late in the week.

>Until 9:99 AM EDT

>At 000 EDT, a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located near Fitchburg, or 5 miles northwest of Leominster, moving southeast at 30 miles per hour.

>Hazard: Tornado

>Source: Radar indicated rotation

>Impact: Flying debris may be deadly to those caught without shelter. Mobile homes will be damaged or destroyed. Damage to roofs, windows, and vehicles will occur.  Tree damage is likely.

>This dangerous storm will be near: Your moms house around 888 am

>Take cover now! Move to a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows. If you are outdoors, in a mobile home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from flying debris.

So as you guys may have inferred, I am from Massachusetts. While looking into the 2011 Springfield EF-3, the warnings once the tornado was confirmed often said ""This is a very dangerous situation"" or ""This is an extremely dangerous and life threatening situation"".

1gmhhlb,I started a project for everyone who wants to maximize their positive climate impact through forest restoration,"A lot of people ask, what they can do individually, in addition to lifestyle changes, to maximize their positive impact on climate and environment. Asking that myself, and researching flaws of available alternatives, led me to start a new project, to allow individuals to take measurable climate action through participation in forest restoration at scale.

Of course it should be treated as a complementary solution to political pressure and necessary systemic changes, and not as excuse to continue current state of affairs. But if we can do something extra in the meantime, why not? After all, we have to not only reduce our emissions, but also recapture already emitted CO2.

We are dedicated to plant new forests with mainly ecological functions and not industrial monocultures, to make an actual land cover change and provide additional ecosystem services. We also include trees’ survivability rate in our impact calculations, to not overestimate it. We partner with municipalities and regions, which provide necessary land, and already few of them declared interest in our project.

Our project allows to gradually build towards tangible impact through planting subscriptions. In our case, they are different from other subscription-based services, as you don’t lose your impact when decide to cancel it, as already planted trees will keep recapturing CO2 for you. Such model just makes reaching a proper scale of impact more available.

We also provide feedback on your planting contributions and CO2 recapture journey.

Currently we are building an international community of individuals, who would like to take such climate action with us, so I’d like to invite you to join and bring in your friends!

If it sounds good to you, check our website: [https://greenwedge.eco](https://greenwedge.eco)

Hope to see you joining, so we can reach a critical mass of positive impact!",2024-11-08 12:35:41,0.2136363636363636,0.0761363636363636
1gk2vuc,Social Crowdfunding Platform,"Hi everyone,

I think we can all agree that life can be incredibly unfair. One person is sitting comfortably, enjoying their favorite meal, while someone else on the other side of the world is witnessing their family being torn to shreds—how horrific. Somewhere else, a person has to walk miles just to fetch water infested with bacteria, while another person only needs to extend their arm for the bottle of clean water that’s on their table.

There are countless societal problems in the world—hunger, water scarcity, climate change, education inequality, homelessness, and more. While many people don’t have the financial means to make a difference, they might have the right words, strategies, or ideas to create change.

I’m building a social crowdfunding platform where users can discuss these issues, raise awareness, and propose actionable solutions. The platform promotes collaboration by allowing users to outline solutions in multiple phases. It fosters a community for sharing ideas, engaging in meaningful discussions, and working together to tackle real-world challenges. Leaders can also create and lead projects that the community can follow and support.

The beta will be private and launches on November 30. I’m looking for people interested in joining this journey, providing feedback, and helping shape the platform. If you’re Interested in participating or would like to get to know more about me or the project, you can message me on reddit or add me on discord to have a chat (itsomidkhber).

Thank you for reading, and I will appreciate your input!

1gvgcwo,Do you think the United Nations should be reformed? ,"The United Nations NEEDS to be reformed, Its resolutions are not binding, in addition to the veto power of the security council, it only benefits the interests of the great powers. and the worst of all, wars still happening. 

  
That is why it needs to be reformed, what history has taught us is that crises tend to reform the world order, the Second World War led to the creation of the UN, if the third occurs, I hope for a reform of the United Nations. but I hope it can be achieved without the need for a war, and not even a world government, but adding things like permanent countries to the security council, a weighted veto that needs coalitions and a world parliament, decisions approved by a qualified majority, which strengthens their impact on global policies, this have potential to evolve into a supranational legislative body in the future. in addition to armed forces that are formed by all the armies of the planet, all in order to improve world peace and international union. 

all under this principles: Respect for national sovereignty: No country gives up powers in sensitive areas such as defense or internal politics.  
Subsidiarity: Decisions are made at the lowest possible level, except for essential global issues such as climate change or pandemics.  
Gradual democratization: Indirect citizen representation, with the possibility of international referendums in the future.

By leveraging international frameworks and policies, the UN can help address systemic racism, advocate for reparations, and elevate the call for recognition and sovereignty on a global platform.

1giq19z,Why Did Britain Retain a Permanent Seat on the UN Security Council Instead of India? Did the British once again stole it from India? ,"India was often called the ‘crown jewel’ of the British Empire, playing a role as significant within that empire as Russia did within the Soviet Union. Given this, one could argue that India, upon gaining independence in 1947, should have inherited the responsibilities and privileges associated with a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council rather than Britain, a much smaller nation in comparison.

This raises the question: why didn’t India assume this role? 

Historical precedent exists for such transitions. 

When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Russia took over its permanent seat. 

Similarly, in 1971, the People’s Republic of China replaced the Republic of China on the Council. 

Following this logic, one might ask why India was not similarly considered to succeed Britain on the Council in 1947.”",2024-11-03 15:56:20,0.0,0.046875
