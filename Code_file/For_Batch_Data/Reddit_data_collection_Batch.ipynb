    "# Title: Data Collection and Sentiment Analysis For Batch Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working Procedure\n",
    "The program is structured to include separate user-defined functions for distinct tasks: data collection, CSV file saving, and sentiment analysis. These functions are orchestrated within the main function, which facilitates the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection Function\n",
    "This function utilizes the Reddit API to fetch data. It collects the following fields for each post:\n",
    "- **ID**: Unique identifier of the post.\n",
    "- **Title**: The title of the post.\n",
    "- **SelfText**: The body content of the post.\n",
    "- **Date**: The creation date of the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function ensures that only posts with non-missing `SelfText` data are collected, thereby avoiding empty or irrelevant entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Saving Function\n",
    "This function is responsible for handling and storing data. It:\n",
    "1. Combines newly collected data with previously saved data from the CSV file.\n",
    "2. Performs duplication checks to ensure no redundant entries are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis Function\n",
    "This function applies sentiment analysis to text data using the **TextBlob** sentiment analysis model. It evaluates the sentiment of the text and generates sentiment scores, which are saved for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Function\n",
    "The main function coordinates the workflow by invoking the individual functions. The tasks are to:\n",
    "1. Collect new data at regular intervals.\n",
    "2. Save the collected data to the CSV file 1 for backup.\n",
    "3. Apply sentiment analysis to the collected data.\n",
    "4. Save the processed results to the CSV file 2."
